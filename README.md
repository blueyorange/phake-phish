# Lesson Plan

## Prior Learning
* Vulnerabilities in computer systems such as:
    * Malware; Social engineering, e.g. phishing, people as the ‘weak point’; Brute-force attacks; Denial of service attacks; Data interception and theft; The concept of SQL injection

## Learning Objectives
* Understanding of how to limit the threats posed in 1.4.1
* Understanding of methods to remove vulnerabilities  
* Knowledge/principles of each prevention method:
	* How the attack is used  
	* The purpose of the attack
	* What each prevention method may limit/prevent
	* How it limits the attack

## Learning Outcomes
* *Recall* some vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks
* For each one, *identify* a method of prevention
* For each method, *explain* how it limits the attack

### Student information
20 students, 2 x EAL, 2 x SEND. Computer suite + BYOD. Individual access to computers.
### Starter (5 mins)
Students are asked to access url displayed on board either through QR code or typed url.
The url takes them to a fake google login where they are asked to enter their login details. The username and the password strength are displayed on a slide, client side only.
This leads into a discussion of phishing and the need for password security.
##### Key questions
*What is suspicious about the url?*
*How can we guard against phishing/pharming attacks?*
*What should you do if you are a victim of phishing?*
*What was your password strength? What does password strength mean and why is it important?*
### Recap (5 mins)
Vulnerabilities (students may be familiar with these from a previous lesson). Teacher talk.
*Pivot question: Which vulnerability would strong passwords help to limit?*
### Main (25 mins)
Following quick presentation and teacher-led discussion on methods of preventing attacks, 
students complete a worksheet, on paper or google docs, describing methods of limiting vulnerabilities in computer networks. For each one, they identify the vulnerability or vulnerabilities it helps to limit.
Teacher circulates during this task to give assistance, focusing on SEND, EAL if necessary.
Possible variations on this task would be assigning students into groups covering a particular theme and then snowballing to combine information. This might not be possible due to room.
### Plenary (20 mins)
Students complete related exam question and peer mark.
Any time remaining: kahoot quiz.

### Differentiation
**EAL:** information on slides is not text heavy and uses images/videos to convey meaning.
**SEND**: Nature of support required is not known.
Students have access to online resources which they can access at their own pace once the presentation is over.
